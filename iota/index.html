        <h1 class="welcome">Welcome to the official IOTA website!</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: -75px;">lol no images because i havent scanned my papers yet</p>
        <h1>What's IOTA?</h1>
        <div class="faq">
            IOTA, short for Icosahedron of Total Annihilation, is an<b> object show</b> that is currently being worked on by<a href="https://plz4x.github.io/plz4x"> plz4x</a>. (That's me!)<br>
            If you watch BFDI or II, you might know what these are.<br>
            Basically, object shows are a type of web series where a bunch of inanimate objects battle for a prize, or go on adventures together. There are lots of them out there, and they're my favourite types of YouTube videos!<br>
            Here are some object shows that I like:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Battle for Dream Island</li>
                <li>Inanimate Insanity</li>
                <li>Mysterious Object Super Show (sadly cancelled since 2022)</li>
                <li>Испытание На Миллион Тысяч (Contest for Million of Thousands. Russian is pronounced [ɪspytˈɑnʲijɪ nˈɑ mʲiɭɭʲiˈon tˈysʲʌt͡ʃʲ])</li>
                <li>Animatic Battle</li>
                <li>Love of the S*n ("S*n" is pronounced [sʌn].)</li>
            </ul>
            These shows are animated in Adobe Animate, but since I don't want to have to pay $22.99 a month just for my animations,
            I decided to draw them in comics instead, like Total Firey Island.<br>
            I will also be posting the comic pages on this website, for all to read.
            <p></p>
            The reason why it's called Icosahedron of Total Annihilation is because the prize is an icosahedron.<br>
            This icosahedron can do basically anything you want it to do, such as generate a million dollars, end world hunger, or completely annihilate the world.
            So yeah, basically, it's, like, <strong>really powerful.</strong>
            <p></p>
            Since my website gets barely any traffic, and I have NO IDEA how to do networking, you can't vote.
            That is, unless you come from my school. I'll be asking people around to vote there.<br>
            Sometimes, the contestants themselves will do the voting, but most of the time it'll be my classmates because public voting is much more fun.
