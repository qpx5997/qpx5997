        <h1 class="welcome">Welcome to the official IOTA website!</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: -75px;">lol no images because i havent scanned my papers yet</p>
        <h1>What's IOTA?</h1>
        <div class="faq">
            IOTA, short for Icosahedron of Total Annihilation, is an<b> object show</b> that is currently being worked on by<a href="https://plz4x.github.io/plz4x"> plz4x</a>. (That's me!)<br>
            If you watch BFDI or II, you might know what these are.<br>
            Basically, object shows are a type of web series where a bunch of inanimate objects battle for a prize, or go on adventures together. There are lots of them out there, and they're my favourite types of YouTube videos!<br>
            Here are some object shows that I like:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Battle for Dream Island</li>
                <li>Inanimate Insanity</li>
                <li>Mysterious Object Super Show (sadly cancelled since 2022)</li>
                <li>Испытание На Миллион Тысяч (Contest for Million of Thousands. Russian is pronounced [ɪspytˈɑnʲijɪ nˈɑ mʲiɭɭʲiˈon tˈysʲʌt͡ʃʲ])</li>
                <li>Animatic Battle</li>
                <li>Love of the S*n ("S*n" is pronounced [sʌn].)</li>
            </ul>
            These shows are animated in Adobe Animate, but since I don't want to have to pay $22.99 a month just for my animations,
            I decided to draw them in comics instead, like Total Firey Island.<br>
            I will also be posting the comic pages on this website, for all to read.
        </div>
        <h1>So what's the prize?</h1>
        <div class="faq">
            The prize is an icosahedron.<br>
            But not just any icosahedron.
            <p></p>
            This icosahedron has the power to do pretty much anything — be it generate a million dollars,
            end world hunger, skip unskippable YouTube ads or completely annihilate the world.<br>
            Yes, that's why this object show is called <b>Icosahedron of Total Annihilation</b>.<br>
        </div>
        <h1>How frequently are comics going to come out?</h1>
        <div class="faq">
            It depends. Usually it may take 2-4 months for each episode,
            but some might be delayed because this year I've got a really big exam coming up in September.<br>
            Expect the first episode to come out in March or April of 2026.
        </div>
        <h1>What about voting?</h1>
        <div class="faq">
            Since I have <strong>NO IDEA</strong> how to do networking, you can't vote. Sorry.<br>
            However, I might get some people from my class to vote! So uhh yeah ig.<br>
        </div>
        <h1>Can you tell me some more other random stuff about IOTA?</h1>
        <div class="faq">
            uhh ok ig.
